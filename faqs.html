              Hello Professor, could you, please, advise about the lectures of
              Python. I'm having a clash with another subject at the same time.
              Will there be a possibility to watch the recordings of lectures by
              any chance? Or attending all the lectures in-person is a must
              point for the subject?

                In order to participate in both the lecture and practice, you
                were required to register. If the course is currently full, you
                will need to wait to see if a spot opens up due to someone
                dropping the course. If no spots become available, you will need
                to drop the course. Please inform the coordinators of your
                situation since we have no control over Neptun and cannot
                increase the headcount limit.

                I'm sorry, but it may not be possible to increase the limit of
                the course at this time due to capacity constraints. The limit
                for the course may have been set based on various factors such
                as classroom size, availability of instructors, and resources.
                Increasing the limit beyond what is feasible may compromise the
                quality of the learning experience for all students.
