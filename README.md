# Python Subject at ELTE IK 🎓🐍

## Follow this concise guide to get your Next.js app up and running for further development! 🚀

1. **Install Node.js** 📥: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/. Next.js requires Node.js version 12.0 or newer.

2. **Clone or download the project** 📁: If the project is hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, clone the repository to your local machine using git clone `<repository-url>`. Alternatively, download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

3. **Navigate to the project directory** 💻: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory using the cd command:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/python-lab
    ```

4. **Install dependencies** 🧰: Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. **Start the development server** 🚧: To start the development server, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start the development server on a default port, usually 3000. You can access your application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

6. **Lint your code** ✅: To check your code for potential issues and ensure that it follows best practices, you can run the built-in linter with the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

7. **Build the application** 🏗️: To build the application for production, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command generates an optimized build in the .next folder.

8. **Start the production server** 🌐: After building the application, you can start the production server with the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This command will start the production server on a default port, usually 3000. You can access your application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

You're all set! Have a great time coding and enhancing the ELTE IK Python subject website, and remember to adhere to best practices consistently! 🥳👩‍💻👨‍💻
